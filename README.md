Python support needed

To import the programs onto your CAS, connect the charging cable to your computer's USB-A port, 
download the nessasary drivers to access your CAS (for the TI NSpire CX-II it would be the 
TI-NSpire CX Student Software, and the activation code would be included in the box), and 
drag the program into a desired folder on your CAS.
